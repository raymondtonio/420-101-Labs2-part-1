It is discussed in chapter 2.

Purpose of project: To illustrate the basics of fields, constructors, and methods.
How to start this project: Create one or more TicketMachine objects.


Laboratory #2

2. 100 cents
3.
a - the machine stores a ticket each time you print one.
b - as i inserted 100000, it made no difference and gave no refund
c - even when inserting not enough and print, it still shows the same and print remains the same
5.yes, the third line shows the price i gave for that ticket machine.
6.
7. a- the class diagram has x formed lines on it when you invert it.
b- <identifier> expected. 
c- though not clearly but enough to understand the issue.
8.it is possible
9.it is not.
10. 
- Constructor = public class TicketMachine
- Fields =
 private int price;
 private int balance;
 private int total;
- Methods =
 public TicketMachine(int cost)
 public int getPrice()
 public int getBalance()
 public void insertMoney(int amount)
 public void printTicket()
 
11. 1- methods do not end in parameters 
    2- methods basically have commands such as ; getbalance, getprice etc.
12. constructor 
13.
-alive
-tutor
-game    
14.-
15. Yes, after resorting it in a different order, the class diagram shows the X crossses on it.
    As the class diagram shows X crosses, it shows that the alternate orderings are not possible.
16. yes it is expected, once i tried it, the error shows as (';' expected)
17. private int status;
18. Student class.
19. the following constructor has 2.
    and their types are string for title and double for the price.
20. -
21.public Pet(String petsName)
{ name = petsName;
}
